# Ventile Client

I dont suggest downloading anything from this page, I suggest downloading the Ventile Installer, and it does everything for you! (And AutoUpdate :D)

The discord has the latest updates, the installer and a great community too!

If it is ESSENTIAL to not use the installer, then follow steps below

* Go to `C:\` drive in file explorer
* Create a folder named `temp`
* Create a folder named `VentileClient` inside there.
* Place the `Ventile-Updater.exe` in the `VentileClient` folder
* Inside `VentileClient` create 2 folders named `Launcher` and `Presets`
* Extract `Presets.zip` into the Presets folder
* Delete `Presets.zip`
* Extract `VentileClient.zip` into the `Launcher` folder
* Delete `VentileClient.zip`
* Run `VentileClient.exe`
* Enjoy!

You can create a shortcut for it if you want!
I HIGHLY suggest using the the Ventile Installer, but its up to you!

## NOTES: 
 - If you run into any errors, open and issue or report it as v!bug in our discord server!
 - It does take a bit to open the launcher the first time u install
 - Do not open the Installer twice, as that MAY cause an error !
